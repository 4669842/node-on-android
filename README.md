# Node on Android

Make Node.js apps for Android (Currently only supports ARM64)

Loads up the project in Android Studio and edit the node app in `assets/index.js`.
When running the app it will load Node.js (8.2.1) as a shared library and run it.

It also contains a WebView that for now just accesses localhost:1000

MORE TO COME! :)
